	Initial implementation of the internet cloud node. The component can
	be configured to model packet delay, datarate and drop probability
	between each input-output interface pair. The parameter matrix
	is provided as an XML configuration file. See the README file in the
	component's main directory (src/networklayer/internetcloud) for further
	details.
